Flight booker web application built on Rails 7.0.3.1 and Ruby 3.1 via [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker).

Users are able to search for flights from a seed database, select a desired flight from the returned results, and create 
and confirm a booking for their desired number of passengers.

Tackles advanced form building utilizing Rails' built in form helpers, particularly nested forms and the necessary model associations.

Flight and Passenger models are associated via an intermediary Booking model.
